-- Flyway runs as the schema owner (DB_MIGRATION_USERNAME), which owns
-- sc_acc_accounts_ledger and every table in it. The service connects as
-- the runtime role (${runtime_role}, from DB_USERNAME) and gets only the DML
-- the code issues:
--   account        SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE           (balances and state; accounts are never deleted)
--   journal_entry  SELECT, INSERT                   (insert-only: a correction is a new entry)
--   posting_line   SELECT, INSERT                   (insert-only)
--   outbox_event   SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE   (relay marks, parks and purges rows)
-- plus USAGE on the schema. Not being the owner, it can neither CREATE, ALTER,
-- DROP nor TRUNCATE, and it cannot read flyway_schema_history.
-- Every later migration that adds a table grants the runtime role explicitly.
--
-- Local single-user runs (no DB_MIGRATION_USERNAME) migrate as the runtime
-- role itself; then there is nothing to separate and this migration only says
-- so, because revoking the owner's own privileges would break later migrations.
